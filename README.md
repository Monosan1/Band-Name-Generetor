# Band Name Generetor - AppBrewery 100 Days of Python - Day 1

## Main objetive

This is the first project of the 100 Days of Python Bootcamp from @AppBrewery, and for this first step, I used what I learned on Python (variables, user input, print, conditions,
strings and more)

# How to use it

## 1 - Your Name

Type your name and hit ENTER:

```
Whats your name? 
```

## 2 - Welcome, City and Pet

After this, read the message and follow the instructions.

```
Hello  #exemple#! Welcome my first python project 
 To find whats your band name type the following data:
Type the city that you was born: #exemple2#
And now, type the name of your first pet: #exemple3
```

## 3 - Rock on!

After that, basead on the length of each string that you typed, your name 
```

Your band name is: #exemple2# #exemple3
```

Thats it, thanks for passing by xD
